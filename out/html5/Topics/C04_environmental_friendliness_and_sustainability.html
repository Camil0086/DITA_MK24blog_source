        <p class="p">If you want to buy new furniture and at the same time want to do something good for the
            environment, you should rely on solid wood. This results not only in advantages for
            nature but also for the individual.</p>
        <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Solid wood furniture removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</strong></p>
        <p class="p">Not only that solid wood furniture looks noble, is of high quality and has a long
            lifespan, it also helps the ecosystem to bind the harmful greenhouse gas CO<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>
            in its own wood for a long time and thus manage to counteract climate change.</p>
        <p class="p">But what exactly does it mean?</p>
        <p class="p">Of course, there is a somewhat difficult mechanism behind this, but also not completely
            unknown, as we will now explain to you in detail:</p>
        <p class="p"><img class="image" id="C04_environmental_friendliness_and_sustainability__image_htt_h4m_1pb" src="../Images/smog.jpg" alt="Smog"></p>

            <p class="p">One or the other has probably heard of this term in biology class. But how was that
                again exactly? "Something to say that carbon dioxide in connection with solar energy
                creates products like sugar and oxygen, right?" Roughly summarized, you could
                describe it like this.</p>
            <p class="p">Photosynthesis describes more precisely how green plants produce energy-rich
                substances (glucose C<sub class="ph sub">6</sub>H<sub class="ph sub">12</sub>O<sub class="ph sub">6</sub> and oxygen
                    O<sup class="ph sup">2</sup>) from low-energy substances (carbon dioxide CO<sup class="ph sup">2</sup> and
                water H<sub class="ph sub">2</sub>O) using solar energy. So one can say that plants are something
                like small “solar power plants” that enable us to live on earth through their end
                products.</p>
            <p class="p">And now comes the crucial thing that made us take up the topic in our blog. The trees
                / forests bind the carbon dioxide from the air, which has been converted by
                photosynthesis, into their own wood, and that permanently! This in turn has a
                positive effect on the environment and can also be decisive for the ecological
                balance.</p>

            <p class="p">By manufacturing furniture from solid wood, as we have found, carbon dioxide is
                permanently removed from the cycle of nature. What does it mean?</p>
            <div class="p">
                <ul class="ul" id="C04_environmental_friendliness_and_sustainability__ul_ij2_5qm_1pb">
                    <li class="li">positive impact on the greenhouse effect</li>
                    <li class="li">improvement of the atmosphere, thus more air to breathe</li>
                    <li class="li">counteracting climate change</li>
                    <li class="li">stabilization of the ecological budget</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p class="p">So if you want to buy furniture in the near future and want to do something good for
                the environment, you should rely on solid wood.</p>
