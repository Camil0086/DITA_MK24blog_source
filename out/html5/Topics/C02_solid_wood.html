        <p class="p">The term “solid wood” is used extensively: Especially in the industrial sector or when
            buying furniture one comes across “solid wood”. But not all wood is equally solid. What
            then solid wood actually means? What degree of requirements do solid woods have to meet?
            And are there uniform quality standards?</p>
        <section class="section" id="C_solid_wood__section_jgn_vng_1pb"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Definition: what is solid wood?</h2>
            
            <p class="p">Solid wood refers to wood products in which the wood can be assigned to a tree
                species (e.g. beech, oak or pine). We also speak of pure wood here. Such woods are
                usually naturally processed, i.e. mechanical or chemical means are not used in the
                treatment. In order to be able to process solid wood, certain work steps are
                necessary: ​​For further use, wooden cross-sections or panels are carved out of the
                tree trunk and then cut to size and separated into lamellas and boards for
                industry.</p>

            <p class="p">But how is solid wood furniture made in detail? Contrary to what one might initially
                assume, wooden furniture is not carved out of the trunk in one piece. Instead,
                wooden panels are created from the dried natural wood, which are firmly glued
                together and thus permanently connected to one another. The prerequisite is that the
                wood has the same cross-section, the same length and also the same type of wood. If
                the dried wooden elements are now put together, a laminated wood panel is created,
                from which a solid piece of furniture can now be made.</p>

            <p class="p">From the foregoing we know that wood products made from solid wood must meet certain
                criteria in order to be considered the quality product that solid wood stands for.
                In the case of solid wood products, all parts of a wood species must be assignable.
                That means: all parts must be made of the same solid wood.</p>
            <p class="p">However, there is an exception for furniture: the rear walls of cupboards or bottom
                compartments of drawers are excluded. A cabinet made of solid oak with drawer
                bottoms or a back wall made of wood composite (plywood or MDF) can still carry the
                quality criterion “solid wood”. For furniture that is advertised with the attribute
                “solid”, the fronts, side panels and top panels must be made of solid wood. If
                individual parts are not made of solid wood, one speaks of "partially solid".</p>
            <p class="p"><strong class="ph b">Important:</strong> Veneers, chipboard or MDF panels are not solid wood.</p>

                                    stretch across the surface in the same shape, are indications of

                                    structure "continues". This can be grasped with all senses:
                                    Simply run your finger over the edges and examine the wood image
                                    and check for completeness. If edges made of PVC are glued on,
                                    this indicates that it is not solid wood.</td>
