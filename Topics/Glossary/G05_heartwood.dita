    <glossdef>wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more
        resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs
        spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood
        formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.</glossdef>
